									<h1>Basketball Tinder<br />
									</h1>
									<p></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The project will be developing a smartphone app called Basketball Tinder for 18+ years of age males and females, because it can be a little dangerous for minors to meet up with strangers. Basketball tinder is a basketball playing app for instant matches with any other users to play pickup basketball games. No matter what time of the day it is. No matter where you are, Basketball Tinder will find any basketball court near your location. The app is suitable for anyone, there is no range of skill, so whether you’re poor at the game or you play on a professional scale it welcomes anybody to use the app.
								</p>



									<p>This project will be interesting since people can meet up with new people to play the game of basketball. It’s a good way for anyone to socialise with others and make new friends and new connections. 43.8% of Australian men aged 18-24 are overweight whilst 33.3% of females in the same age group are overweight. 62.5% of Australian men aged 25-34 are overweight and 42.5% of females in the same age group are overweight. This app is a free and easy way to create a solution for the overweight Australians to casually exercise and lower the overall overweight statistics for their age group.
									</p>
									
									
									
										
									<p>This smartphone app will use features imbedded in the app ‘uber’ and ‘tinder.’ Basketball Tinder will use the user’s location to locate where the user is and where other users are just like the app ‘uber.’ It may also use the user’s location when the app isn’t open, which can decrease battery life, but this gives the user an idea of how far other users are and how close nearby basketball courts are to meetup and play basketball. There will be a swipe feature for users to swipe left (reject) or right (like) on other users based on their experience in basketball and how seriously they like to play. There will be a profile feature where users can add a caption about themselves and there will also be a section where the users give themselves a rating out of 5 for their skill level and another rating out of 5 for their competitiveness for others to see. It also has a rating system with a comment to leave after each game session. Users can rate other users out of 5 based on the experience they had during the meetup they had, so if you flake other user’s or have a toxic attitude towards others and make it an unpleasant experience for other users, this may harm your profile and give insight to users in future meetups.  Basketball Tinder will have an unlimited amount the user can swipe on another user, but a limit of 6 matches a day, because it will be assumed that it will take 4 hours in total to meet and play basketball with another user. The app will notify the user if they’ve matched with another user or if there are other users nearby. There will be no in app purchases in Basketball Tinder and everything is completely free. There will be a chat area for the user to talk to their matches. This feature will be just like any other social messaging platform such as messenger or Instagram direct message, which will make it easy for the user to communicate with other users. Another feature in Basketball Tinder is that the user can link their social media on their profile to see whether users have mutual friends amongst each other which can lead to friendly basketball games together.

									<p>Phones will be a requirement alongside a computer to work on this project. Tools required include, mit app inventor or Xcode to create the app. Coding languages such as Java, Python and C++ will be needed to develop software and create various programs for the app.  Hardware such as GPS receiver which indicates the user’s location. A camera is also needed for the app to take photos of yourself to upload a display photo for others to view. The app will also need access to the users’ device’s gallery/photo booth to upload a photo for their display photo.  
									</p>
									
									
									<p>Skills that’ll need to be required for the project would be to know how to code java language to create the app or minor projects for the app on programs such as mit app inventor or Xcode. It won’t be easy to find the skills needed for the project idea as I need experience in making an app or programs for the app and I need to be an expert or very skilled in coding java language to be able to write the software needed. It’s feasible to find the hardware required as they’re very easily accessible. 
									</p>
									
									If the project is successful, the outcome of this will be going further and working on creating the app for people to install. Many updates will be made not only because of the inevitable errors and problems, but also if there are improvements made to the app’s features. The original problem of overweight people in the age group of 18-34 will be reduced slowly and this can lead many people to the start of a new and healthy lifestyle. The impact that the development of the app will make is that it will allow many people to gain interest in not only exercising but also in the game of basketball.
